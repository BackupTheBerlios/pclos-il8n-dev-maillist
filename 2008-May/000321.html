oh sorry ...

they are several more answers i need to give that are not in your 
question but that you will ask soon so i will answer them now, once for 
good.

- we have yet done a tremendous amount of work
- we explored several aspect of i18n and i10n
- It appears that 3 major fields of action are to be covered in the 
overall project development
- 1 : software translation
- 2 : documentation translation
- 3 : translation distribution

- software translation can be divided in  subfields of action
- 1 : translating in an existing framework
- 2 : implementing a framework for translation
- field one is regular po and .desktop translation, the second is 
toolization of translation using your scripts an implementing softwares 
with not i18n framework like mklivecd with new localizable features ... 
we yet modifyed synaptic to make it language friendly.

- Documentation translation can also be divided in two fields of action
- 1 : internal documentation translation
- 2 : external documentation translation
- internal points at html files embedded in the live cd and dedicated to 
help the user getting started with pclinuxos, the rest is mainly the 
wiki.... in this mail, i'm referring to a guideline dedicated to tell 
the user how to localize his system rather than a page dedicated to 
language remaster ... and this could be a cross project between us and 
the doc project ...

- Translation distribution can also be done in two ways
- 1 : srpm patching
- 2 : submitting translation to software developers
- srpm patching can be done either by s, the ripper gang or santa team, 
the submission can only be provided by us ... in the end, both can be 
done but we need to pick a solution and i really believe that waiting is 
a nonsense since , on a very practical way, we would add to the workload 
rather than reducing it, so our work won't be of any help if we don't do 
it ourself by patching the srpms and submitting additional translation 
to software dev for implementation in future release!

in the end, we have several area where we have opportunities to 
collaborate with other project and thus grant a liability and stability 
to the effort we've made ...

the big picture would be to progressively inject i18n content in the 
main repo ... since tex yet mentioned he neither have time and skills to 
do it ... since we have both, why not doing it

At the very moment, there is a place which host several pclinuxos 
related projects, i18n is one of those and that place is mypclinuxos... 
if i don't post there, no one else does despite the recent interest of 
alessio into this ... we have a wiki and a forum running, more can be 
added once its needed, eventually a i18n.mypclinuxos.com with a full 
toolset, dedicated repository and forum with a documentation wiki 
dedicated to translators ... but first we need to write up the various 
area of action and the task that needs to be fulfilled, write down a 
road map ... get organized before jumping on anything else ...

I have more time than i had but i'm not even 30% on pclinuxos at the 
very moment, so don't expect me to take all decision alone and neither 
expect me to carry on all the test and moderation, i'm more a 
coordinator than a chief, i'm a leader ... you are the real guts of this 
project...

the wiki mentioned are the one @ mypclinuxos 
(<A HREF="http://www.mypclinuxos.com/doku.php/localization">http://www.mypclinuxos.com/doku.php/localization</A>) and the one of the 
doc project (<A HREF="http://docs.pclinuxos.com/HomePage">http://docs.pclinuxos.com/HomePage</A>)

David Smid a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> didouph napsal(a):
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> a subproject in the i18n project, dedicated to providing informations on 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> how to localize the system ... this is a long term task that need 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> several critical point to be checked in order to be effective ... the 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> writeup would need to be translated and this means that more than you 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> needs to take a lok at it and carry it on ... so its in a way a cross 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> project between doc and i18n and a subproject of i18n !
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> DidouPh
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I'm a little bit lost in this. If I understand it right, it has
</I>&gt;<i> something to do with the liveCD i18n project we were talking about.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Where do you want this project to live ? Where should it have its wiki ?
</I>&gt;<i> Do you want to separate it from the pclos-i18n project ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Too much questions, I know, but I'm really confused.
</I>&gt;<i>
