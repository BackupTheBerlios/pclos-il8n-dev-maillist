<PRE>Hi, didouph!

I agree with you, we need some roadmap and we need to let users know what we've 
achieved until now. The mailing list is quite active, but it's only for (few of)
 us. What users see is a half-dead forum and a dead wiki plus non-localised rpms
. Hence, they might think that the il18n team is not productive, which is not tr
ue.
I think the first thing to do is the localisation of the control center or anyth
ing else which would be outstanding. Something that people immediately spot. You
 mentioned /etc/skel. Yes, why not?
Meanwhile, we should also inform the users of our progress. Translators, and who
ever is involved, should send a small periodic report through the mailing-list a
nd we should public on our wiki what is going on. Moreover, if we hear from each
 other more often, we get a better feeling of our vitality.
When our translations are implemented in an important rpm, we should be allowed 
to announce it on the main pclos webpage. This could also attract the interest o
f new people on our work.

At the moment I'm too busy to put a lot of effort in this, but from June I had a
lready planned to take care of our wiki. I would write how to join our project, 
what to do to start translating, descriptions of how a desktop file works and ho
w a po file works, summary of our concrete plans, news on what's new and so on

I'd also like to try to implement gettext in scripts such as mkremaster and live
usb. Or maybe David can do that, since he has already done it for VIT, am I wron
g? (I would have to learn completely for scratch)

As I said, I can't give you much of my time until the end of May, but from June 
I'll be yours.
