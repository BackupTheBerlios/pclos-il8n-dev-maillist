<PRE>pierre-henri-ramboz napsal(a):
&gt;<i> David Smid a &#233;crit :
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Just a few questions for DidouPh:
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> Have you tried to use the scripts I sent you ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> not yet for i didn't understood how they work and need time to get 
</I>&gt;<i> deeper into this... honestly i never use some software i don't 
</I>&gt;<i> understand the mechanism of ... but i yet told you that ... it sounds 
</I>&gt;<i> awesome but i don't understand the bennefits and drawback either ... i 
</I>&gt;<i> think i really need a practical example to tell you what i think of it 
</I>&gt;<i> and to use it either ... at the very moment, if it helps save time i'm 
</I>&gt;<i> all for it ! if it facilitate the translation and incorporation in 
</I>&gt;<i> mainstream, i'm all for it ...
</I>
OK, I'll try to give you a better explanation.

1) What's wrong on current way of desktop files i18n and l10n
- Translations are contained in .desktop files. This brings a very high
risk of damaging it while adding or editing translations. A .desktop
file is an integral part of software and as such it should not be
touched by anybody else than the software authors.
- Translations of messages for one locale are scattered among tens or
hundreds of tiny files. It's very hard to guess what's already
translated and what is not.
- You cannot use standard l10n tools (KBabel).
- It's quite probable that two or more language teams might want to edit
one .desktop file at the same time. That would need someone to solve the
conflicts.

2) How should it look like to solve the problems mentioned above
- .desktop file should be a &quot;skeleton&quot; that would contain only English
phrases. No translations here.
- ALL translated strings of ALL .desktop files for ONE locale should be
contained in ONE file (preferably .po file).
- These files should be thought of as the &quot;source&quot; files, that can be
edited, but not used in software binary release.
- Those &quot;classic&quot; .desktop files with all available translations should
be able to be built anytime from the &quot;sources&quot;.
- Notice, that there are no .mo files needed nor involved at all.

3) Solution for this problem is already here. Its name is intltool.
It's routinely used in many software projects. Unfortunately
documentation of intltool utilities is a little bit &quot;fuzzy&quot;.
It took me quite a lot of time to understand what they really do.
The scripts I've sent you are just simple wrappers of intltool utilities
adapted for our situation. Nothing else.
I'll try to explain what they do. Don't hesitate to make experiments -
just copy desktop-files tree to some temporary location, copy the
scripts to this desktop-files directory, launch the scripts and watch
what happens.

make_intltool_ready
===================
&lt;-------------- converts current state to the new infrastructure. Needed
to be launched only once.

#!/bin/sh

# Error fixes
...
&lt;-------------- This part of script fixes a lot of problems with current
.desktop files. Otherwise, they couldn't have been adapted.

# intltool adaption process
mkdir po

intltool-prepare
&lt;------------------ Creates .desktop.in files from .desktop files by
removing of all translations. These translations are moved to .po files
- one .po files per each locale. Also creates po/POTFILES.in with list
of all .desktop.in files.

cd po
sed -i -e '1 i[encoding: UTF-8]' POTFILES.in
INTLTOOL_EXTRACT=/usr/bin/intltool-extract intltool-update -p -g
desktop-files
&lt;------------------ Creates desktop-files.pot file

cat &gt; header &lt;&lt;EOT

for fil in `ls *.po`
do
    LOCALE=${fil%%.po}
    echo &quot;Processing $LOCALE ...&quot;
    sed -e &quot;s/%locale/$LOCALE/g&quot; header &gt; header.tmp
    cat header.tmp $fil &gt; $fil.tmp
    mv -f $fil.tmp $fil
    INTLTOOL_EXTRACT=/usr/bin/intltool-extract intltool-update -d -g
desktop-files $LOCALE
&lt;------------------- Adds proper header to all .po files and appends all
untranslated messages from desktop-files.pot

done
rm -f header.tmp

find . -name *.in -not -name POTFILES.in -print | (while read; do rm -f
${REPLY%%.in}; done )
&lt;------------------- Deletes all original .desktop files, they are not
needed now. Only .desktop.in files should remain.



make_intltool_update
====================
&lt;------------------- Updates desktop-files.pot and all .po files after
adding new .desktop file(s) to the tree. Also adds new .desktop.in items
to the list in POTFILES.in.

#!/bin/sh

intltool-prepare
&lt;------------------- Processes newly added .desktop files and creates
.desktop.in files from them

cd po
INTLTOOL_EXTRACT=/usr/bin/intltool-extract intltool-update -p -g
desktop-files
&lt;------------------- Updates desktop-files.pot

for fil in `ls *.po`
do
    LOCALE=${fil%%.po}
    echo &quot;Processing $LOCALE ...&quot;
    msguniq $fil -o $fil.tmp
    mv -f $fil.tmp $fil
    INTLTOOL_EXTRACT=/usr/bin/intltool-extract intltool-update -d -g
desktop-files $LOCALE
&lt;------------------- Adds new messages to all .po files, makes sure all
msgids are unique.

done

find . -name *.in -not -name POTFILES.in -print | (while read; do rm -f
${REPLY%%.in}; done )
&lt;------------------- Deletes all newly added .desktop files, they are
not needed now. Only .desktop.in files should remain.




build_desktop_files
===================
&lt;------------------- Builds all .desktop files from source .desktop.in
files and .po files, result will be saved in directory
../desktop-files-build, directory tree will be mirrored.
In ../desktop-files-build, you will get exactly the same result, the
same files, that are held in CVS now. But they are only a result of
build process, not the editable sources. They should not be in CVS.
These .desktop files can be injected to repository packages, the same
way they are getting there now.

#!/bin/sh

mkdir ../desktop-files-build 2&gt;/dev/null

find . -type d -not -name CVS -not -name .svn -not -path &quot;./po&quot; -exec
mkdir -p ../desktop-files-build/{} \;
&lt;------------------- Copies directory structure to ../desktop-files-build

find . -name &quot;*.in&quot; -not -name POTFILES.in -print | while read
do
    intltool-merge -d -u -c po/.intltool-merge-cache po &quot;$REPLY&quot;
../desktop-files-build/&quot;${REPLY%%.in}&quot;
&lt;------------------- Builds .desktop files from .desktop.in source
files, uses .po files to get messages translations.

done

&gt;&gt;<i> Do you plan to use this infrastructure for desktop-files localization ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> if i understand it and it is accepted by the pclinuxos packagers and 
</I>&gt;<i> (who knows) kde packagers for theire cvs, yes (don't forget that 50% of 
</I>&gt;<i> the desktop files in the cvs are KDE desktop file ... so it means we are 
</I>&gt;<i> bleeding edge of the i18n work in this area !
</I>
It is not necessary for packagers to accept our work in form of
.desktop.in + .po translations combo, although it's preferable.
We can provide ordinary .desktop files as well, just like we provided
them before.

&gt;&gt;<i> How exactly get the translations from our CVS to mainstream packages now (I 
</I>&gt;&gt;<i> think Gettinther is somehow involved in this ...) ?
</I>&gt;&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> You have two options ...
</I>&gt;<i> 1 : get added by the software packager in the package during an update!
</I>&gt;<i> 2 : get added to the package by a 3rd party packager (gettinther, me, you ?)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> we have no trail of addition, we just make noise !
</I>
There is also a third option: to get it added upstream by the software
author.

&gt;<i> unfortunately, its opensource, we propose and the ripper gang do as they 
</I>&gt;<i> wish ... so that's why a I18N team active in the developement of 100% 
</I>&gt;<i> localized iso is a must have @ mypclinuxos, to endavour a nonofficial 
</I>&gt;<i> distribution with i18n support and &quot;compliant&quot; rpms with specific 
</I>&gt;<i> repository ...
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> for desktop files or any piece of software that we develop or any 
</I>&gt;<i> framework we develop, the big thing is will it be added ... except for 
</I>&gt;<i> what i and gettinther, especially the DrakxTools and synaptic aswell as 
</I>&gt;<i> some desktop files ... almost everything is &quot;to be done&quot; and not done yet
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> at the very moment i'm wondering if a flavored distribution isn't the 
</I>&gt;<i> final objective ... since i18n team is very &quot;limitated&quot; in its weight 
</I>&gt;<i> upon the evolution and update of pclinuxos ...
</I>
OK, so our only chance is to make the process of adding our achievements
to PCLOS packages as simple as possible. We need to create some
automatic facility for creating patches - because patches are very easy
to add to SRPM. We need to bombard packagers with i18n and l10n patches
because they can't refuse them just because their incorporation involves
too much work.
