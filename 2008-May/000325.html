<PRE>SORRY

i had to resend it to the list for the reason that only alessio got it :/

<A HREF="https://lists.berlios.de/mailman/listinfo/pclos-il8n-dev">alessioadamo at fastwebnet.it</A> a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Hi, didouph!
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> I agree with you, we need some roadmap and we need to let users know what we've 
</I>&gt;<i> achieved until now. The mailing list is quite active, but it's only for(few of)
</I>&gt;<i>  us. What users see is a half-dead forum and a dead wiki plus non-localised rpms
</I>&gt;<i> . Hence, they might think that the il18n team is not productive, which is not tr
</I>&gt;<i> ue.
</I>
thats the point !! check the mailing list archive ... i already warned
people about that ! we lost a lot of activity last yet due to that !

&gt;<i> I think the first thing to do is the localisation of the control centeror anyth
</I>&gt;<i> ing else which would be outstanding. Something that people immediately spot. You
</I>&gt;<i>  mentioned /etc/skel. Yes, why not?
</I>
that's yet the plan ... the roadmap aims to translate drakxtools and
synaptic first, then desktop files and doc ... the rest is OPTIONAL. Tex
is rebuilding the drakxtools from mandy 2008 so we will have to restart
the work from scratch really soon !!

&gt;<i> Meanwhile, we should also inform the users of our progress. Translators, and who
</I>&gt;<i> ever is involved, should send a small periodic report through the mailing-list a
</I>&gt;<i> nd we should public on our wiki what is going on.
</I>
we yet do that on the mailing list ... its hard to do it on the
mypclinuxos wiki and the &quot;matoilnet&quot; wiki needs to be moved on the
mypclinuxos one ... having a little cms or blog front page would be nice
... why not doing it @ berlios ?

  Moreover, if we hear from each
&gt;<i>  other more often, we get a better feeling of our vitality.
</I>&gt;<i> When our translations are implemented in an important rpm, we should beallowed 
</I>&gt;<i> to announce it on the main pclos webpage.
</I>
NO, we are not pclinuxos ripper gang ... anyway , try to imagine what
would the front page of pclinuxos be if any single repository update got
reported on frontpage ? a freaking mess ... only with us, it would be 
something to get mad and sick at if we have only 10% of the success we 
expect !!

  This could also attract the interest o
&gt;<i> f new people on our work.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
we could report the overall but not the detailed progress ... anything
else would sound and echo as g33kery

&gt;<i> At the moment I'm too busy to put a lot of effort in this, but from June I had a
</I>&gt;<i> lready planned to take care of our wiki. I would write how to join our project, 
</I>&gt;<i> what to do to start translating, descriptions of how a desktop file works and ho
</I>&gt;<i> w a po file works, summary of our concrete plans, news on what's new and so on
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
we are not in a hurry, take care and take your time

&gt;<i> I'd also like to try to implement gettext in scripts such as mkremasterand live
</I>&gt;<i> usb. Or maybe David can do that, since he has already done it for VIT, am I wron
</I>&gt;<i> g? (I would have to learn completely for scratch)
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
yes david is your main interlocutor on that very topic, i think he yet
did some progress in this way ...

&gt;<i> As I said, I can't give you much of my time until the end of May, but from June 
</I>&gt;<i> I'll be yours.
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>
thanks Alessio

I will think about a frontpage blog for the project and eventually a
berlios or a mypclinuxos page

if you have any proposal ...

DidouPh
