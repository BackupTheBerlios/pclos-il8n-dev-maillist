<PRE>David Smid a &#233;crit :
&gt;<i> Just a few questions for DidouPh:
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>&gt;<i> Have you tried to use the scripts I sent you ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>not yet for i didn't understood how they work and need time to get 
deeper into this... honestly i never use some software i don't 
understand the mechanism of ... but i yet told you that ... it sounds 
awesome but i don't understand the bennefits and drawback either ... i 
think i really need a practical example to tell you what i think of it 
and to use it either ... at the very moment, if it helps save time i'm 
all for it ! if it facilitate the translation and incorporation in 
mainstream, i'm all for it ...
&gt;<i> Did you encounter any problems ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>not yet, of course
&gt;<i> Do you think it's a good idea ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>i don't know ...
&gt;<i> Do you plan to use this infrastructure for desktop-files localization ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>if i understand it and it is accepted by the pclinuxos packagers and 
(who knows) kde packagers for theire cvs, yes (don't forget that 50% of 
the desktop files in the cvs are KDE desktop file ... so it means we are 
bleeding edge of the i18n work in this area !
&gt;<i> How exactly get the translations from our CVS to mainstream packages now (I 
</I>&gt;<i> think Gettinther is somehow involved in this ...) ?
</I>&gt;<i> 
</I>You have two options ...
1 : get added by the software packager in the package during an update!
2 : get added to the package by a 3rd party packager (gettinther, me, you ?)

we have no trail of addition, we just make noise !

unfortunately, its opensource, we propose and the ripper gang do as they 
wish ... so that's why a I18N team active in the developement of 100% 
localized iso is a must have @ mypclinuxos, to endavour a nonofficial 
distribution with i18n support and &quot;compliant&quot; rpms with specific 
repository ...

for desktop files or any piece of software that we develop or any 
framework we develop, the big thing is will it be added ... except for 
what i and gettinther, especially the DrakxTools and synaptic aswell as 
some desktop files ... almost everything is &quot;to be done&quot; and not done yet

at the very moment i'm wondering if a flavored distribution isn't the 
final objective ... since i18n team is very &quot;limitated&quot; in its weight 
upon the evolution and update of pclinuxos ...
