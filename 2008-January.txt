Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] VIT .pot file, i18n patch,
	czech translation and create_po utility
Message-ID: <479F3D26.305@smidovi.eu>

Hello,

Here is all you need to translate VIT (Video Installation Tool).
As this tool changes pretty often, I made a utility create_po that is capable to 
  extract new untranslated messages from the vit script and add them to existing 
.po file.

You'll need to patch the vit script with my i18n patch [ patch -p0 < 
vit.i18n.patch ] or to wait till the patched version appears in testing.
