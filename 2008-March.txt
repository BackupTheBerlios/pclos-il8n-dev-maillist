There was an error in this file, last msgid was doubled, I had to delete "(BETA 
RELEASE)" text from that msgid and attempted to locate and delete corresponding 
Chinese msgstr fraction.
Could you review the .po if I didn't make a mistake as my Chinese knowledge is 
VERY limited (I'm kidding, I don't understand a single Chinese character :-) ?

Hi i'm Luca Franceschini (aka Lupin3rd),
i want to inform the list that a pclinuxos.it user (aka Gianvacca)
translated the core system.

The translation need a revision but seem good.

How can we test a live cd with this translation? Is there a simple way
to create it? In this way some italian people can test...

Thanks
Luca

hi lupin3rd

files have been added to the cvs

to test those files, people simply need to install the kde locale 
i18n-it and locale then set theyre system to behave with italian as 
default language for both pclinuxos and kde then, they need to convert 
the po files to mo files using the command

msgfmt imput.po -o output.mo

replace imput and output with the name of mo file you wish to use...

then paste those files in the appropriate place, as root :

/usr/share/locale/it_IT/LC_MESSAGES/
or
/usr/share/locale/it/LC_MESSAGES/

log out and back in

all should be ok

next, about the remaster ...

preinstall the translation as explained above then open a terminal as 
root and type remasterme !
if you want, you may find a remastergui in synaptic

thanks for your help... look forward to the next core tools update for 
addition of those translations in mainstream.

Hello David,

Sorry it took a while to get this small thing done but a new school term had 
just started.

Hi, DidouPh!

| ok
|
|first feedback ...
|
|1 : The desktop file archive you've sent me isn't a plain text file |and
|seems to have been damaged in transfer ... please send a proper |tar.gz
|archive or a plain text file atachement to let me give it a look :)

I hope this time it's plain text.

|2 : Dark theme and Dark2 theme xml files are ok but we need the
|appropriate entries in
|/usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/Dark2/GdmGreeterTheme.desktop
|/usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/Dark2/KdmGreeterTheme.desktop
|/usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/Dark/GdmGreeterTheme.desktop
|/usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/Dark/KdmGreeterTheme.desktop
|
|like :
|
|Greeter[nl]=theme-nl.xml
|Name[nl]=Donker2
|Description[nl]=Donker2 KDM Thema met gebruikerslijst voor PCLinuxOS |2007
|Author[nl]=PCLinuxOS
|
|please, send me updated version of those files with your changes

This information is already in the text file I'm sending you

|3 : The mo files are not needed only the po are added to the cvs and |in
|the srpms

Ok, I asked you to add them just because I've seen also mo files on berlios. No 
problem about it. 

|4 : the synaptic po is slightly different in pclinuxos than in |mandriva
|... gettinther built us a i18n one ... grabb the pot file atached to
|this mail and send it back to the mailing list please...

Sir, yes sir!

|since berlios is down at the very moment, i won't be able to put the |po
|online but since everything but what i mentioned is ok i will publish |it
|online assap ...

No problem, also because I re-checked and re-corrected again all the po files. S
o these which I'm sending you this time can be defined the release candidate po 
files. So, forget about the others ;-)

|just don't forget your personal and team credit ... on the po files |and
|on mypclinuxos wiki ... i'm also looking for a co-mod for the project |so
|if you have spare time ... i'm a taker :)
|
|DidouPh

I'm using more than my spare time for this at the moment, but from june I'll be 
glad to help you.

Thanks.

Alessio.

Message-ID: <9079207.2217981206804766333.JavaMail.root@pr001msr>

Hi, guys!
Sorry to send again this stuff, but I've just updated it with a ref to backgroun
d-it.png which contains the login information in italian for the LiveCD login. O
f course I also created the background file background-it.png for both the theme
s.

Locations:

/usr/share/apps/kdm/themes/Dark and Dark2 respectively

By the way, I have a question. Even if in the .desktop files there is a ref to t
heme-it.xml, this theme is not open. If I substitute the content of theme.xml wi
th the content of theme-it.xml, however, I can see that the italian-specific the
me is loaded. Yet I can only notice it because of the background, the text is st
ill in english. Is this normal?

PS. Meanwhile I'm translating Synaptic.po 
One problem: when I save, both poEdit and KBabel are not able to create the mo f
ile, and show an error message, because of these kind of problems:
16:26:47: /root/Linux traduzioni/synapticnew.po:1154: keyword "mailto" unknown
16:26:47: /root/Linux traduzioni/synapticnew.po:1152: missing `msgstr' section
16:26:47: /root/Linux traduzioni/synapticnew.po:1154:33: parse error
16:26:47: /root/Linux traduzioni/synapticnew.po:1154: keyword "wybo" unknown
[...]
In the text there are mailto hrefs which cause these problems. Should I not care
?

Have a nice weekend!

Alessio.
