Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] xaralx french translation
Message-ID: <47291D50.60107@laposte.net>

hi

I'm one of MyPCLinuxOS.com admin and the leader of PCLinuxOS translation 
group. I'm also working on the packaging as RPM for PCLinuxOS of the 
xaraLx application and libraries.

I recently registered on launchpad.net in order to take part in xaralx 
translation. after a few days of delay i got the file and translated a 
lot of the fuzzy in the french file and some untranslated (140) strings ...

unfortunately i noticed i was not allowed to upload my files but only to 
make proposal for translation ... the launchpad interface being what it 
is ... is not my peace of cake and i would rather submit my translation 
by upload rather than by per/string proposal ... since a 5 days delay 
was applied to my xaralx.po download ... what would be a per string 
delay ? ...  who knows ?... anyway ... i understand that i need to sign 
that : 
http://www.xaraxtreme.org/images/pdf/16-01-06/contributor_agreement.pdf

but can't you point me to a way to do this electronically ?

i have about 20 translators who will be ready and willing to take part 
in this project and commit additions to the XaraLx translation ... which 
sounds if not stalled, lacunar !

should i continue the translation and release an unofficial more 
performent than the official or seek a simple trunk submission and seek 
integration in an open way ?

I have not yet commited this file to the PCLOS-i18n team CVS for the 
above reason ... but once i'll be over with the french translation, i 
will upload my po for additional translation on our cvs !

i really would like you to point me to a simple way not to do it 
"underground" but to get the community enjoy the Xara experience in a 
language they understand ...

thanks for your attention

DidouPh aka Pierre-Henri Ramboz

ps : a copy of this message has been sent to the i18n-team for pclinuxos !

Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] Language Localized Remaster HOWTO #1
Message-ID: <472B4041.40103@smidovi.eu>

INTRODUCTION

It is important to note that the utilities for live CD creation and booting ARE
NOT PCLinuxOS specific. These utilities are part of livecd project
(http://livecd.berlios.de/) and are independent on PCLinuxOS. Although there are
many options in bootmenu and mklivecd script, some of them have no effect on
PCLinuxOS. Most of them are parts of Mandriva legacy. PCLinuxOS would need to be
fixed up to be able to use those broken options.

1. Bootmenu

1.1 Overview

The live CD bootmenu is not driven by Grub as many people assume but by Isolinux
which is a part of Syslinux project (http://syslinux.zytor.com/). Isolinux
implements a mechanism that allows boot from CD and run a bootmenu on any
hardware configuration. After you select a bootmenu item, Isolinux gives control
to image specified in that bootmenu item configuration and is no longer active.
The only way for Isolinux to influence what follows next is to pass parameters
to image being booted (usually kernel). But it's up to booting OS if it uses
these parameters or not.

Normally, Isolinux operates in text mode. To operate in graphics, gfxboot
extension must be used. All bootmenu appearance and behaviour is defined in a
gfxboot theme. PCLOS mklivecd uses gfxboot theme 'pclinuxos' contained in
package 'pclinuxos-gfxboot-theme'. Contents of this package can be found in
/usr/share/gfxboot/themes/pclinuxos.

Live CD has the following structure:

/boot/grub/		- not used
/isolinux/
	bootlogo	* gfxboot theme definition
	lang		* contains code of default language (not present in original 'pclinuxos'
theme)
	mediacheck	- image containing program capable of checking CD's MD5 sum
	memtest		- image containing program capable of testing RAM health
	vmlinuz		- linux kernel image
	isolinux.bin	- main Isolinux program, bootmenu entry point
	boot.cat	- catalog ???
	isolinux.cfg	- main menu definition
	star.dat	* ???
	16x16.fnt	* bootmenu font
	initrd.gz	- initial RAM disk image containing lightweight version of linux
	back.jpg	* bootmenu background screen
	timer_a.jpg	* timer animation sprites
	welcome.jpg	* initial screen
	pclinuxos.pcx	* PCLinuxOS logo that appears on initial screen
	*.tr		* language specific interface translations (does not affect main menu)
	*.hlp		* language specific help translations


Files marked with (-) belong to Isolinux and those marked with (*) belong to
gfxboot extension.

TO BE CONTINUED...

David

guys, i know this is none of your busyness (basically)
but here is an information that is of some interrest for the overall 
project and that should solve our issue with the "i18n" framework for 
mklivecd on both pclinuxos and mandriva.

Tom kelly just sent me an e.mail to transfer me the lead of the mklivecd 
project

this means that thanks to david's imput, the code may evolve to a new 
version if compliant with mandriva and our work will beggin to interact 
with SEVERAL distribution since i would keep the lead of both projects.

what do you think of it and what if mklivecd had to become a part of the 
i18n project's core !

if it does, it will turn the project into a meta distribution one and 
would drag us away from mypclinuxos, at least for a time !

I think having mklivecd under our control would be a great advantage.
Which distributions are using mklivecd ?

i think the good question is ... wich distribution isn't
it's quite a responsability that tom gives me with it ...
mklivecd is the tool that made linux take a step beyond with the 
demomode and is the main element of the sucess of distributions like 
pclinuxos / ubuntu and mandriva ... lets not forget about slax and lg3d !

and the funny thing is that you (david) tom, ike, textar and i are the 
last active dev on that very software. all pclinuxos users and active 
community actors ...

Well, I think you're wrong here. Certainly, there are many linux live CDs but
not all of them are build using mklivecd. Slax uses MySlax Creator, Ubuntu uses
Reconstructor, and so on. As far as I know, mklivecd is used only by Mandriva
and it's descendants.
Even so, PCLinuxOS version of mklivecd is PCLOS specific and is not portable
without editing (it has hard-wired usage of pclinuxos gfxboot theme).
Also note, that project http://mklivecd.sourceforge.net/ is completely different
thing, it has nothing in common with "our" mklivecd.

not to go too deep into this ...
a : yes it's kind of not the same on every distro
b : http://mklivecd.sourceforge.net/ =>  Last Modified: Thu, May 04 
08:34:12 UTC 2002 it's an archaism and the "genesis" of livecd project !
c : http://livecd.berlios.de/?Linux_Distros_Using_LiveCD
d : mandy and pclinuxos uses patched mklivecd scripts bu both in the 
livecd framework !
e : (any)buntu and (any)lax(other) uses forked livecd ... check the code 
and developers forum !

mklivecd is how we usually refer to it in pclos but is actually the 
livecd framework hosted and developed @ berlios.de

but this is not the point in all of this ... the real point is to get it 
more and more functional & flexible by eventually implement a modular 
building process to get it easily portable and have a unified framework 
to get it running !

the amount of variable needed to built a livecd are so few that i don't 
think it's such a big deal anyway and the fact that the software is 
available as binary release on both debian and consors is a key 
information and a must not be put under ...

maybe i got missunderstood in my previous message, but what we are 
talking about is a distribution independent tool that is driven by a 
script called mklivecd wich variant are quite exotic on pclinuxos

for instance ... i used both pclinuxos core and ike's patched cvs 
mklivecd and tools ... the best imo is the cvs one wich is more 
efficient, facst and don't produces glitches ...

last, it lacks a lot of features like i18n framework and gettex support 
... and you butyfull partches ...

about those patches, i don't know if you noticed it but i sent em to 
both tex and tom for 2 integration, not 1 ... so there would be more 
compatibility ....

lets not hijack this mailing list, there is a developer list @ berlios 
for livecd users and developers !

hello :

Still no answer to my previous posts and, "patch to mklivecd and rc 
files" topic got removed. does that means you don't care or enjoy those 
patches ?

i know you're kind of busy but once again, we need to know your point of 
view on thothe hacks to keep implementing the i18n framework on 
pclinuxos. Since livecd utils and mklivcd are key features to pclinuxos 
expansion ... we really need to have your input on that very issue !
[/quote]

etjr has already applied those patches to mklivecd.


[/quote]

lets wait for the mklivecd rpm to be updated or lets work from cvs :)

Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] Language Localized Remaster HOWTO #2
Message-ID: <47346AA0.70504@smidovi.eu>

1.2 Customizing bootmenu

The main menu of the boot screen that let you select what to boot is configured
in isolinux.cfg. This file is not i18n ready and thus does not support menu item
titles in multiple languages. Therefore it does not reflect selected language.
It is recommended to translate the titles to the language of your remaster.
UTF-8 characters can be used in the titles but there cannot be any spaces
because Isolinux interprets space as end of string. This limitation can be
overcome by using unicode character U+00A0 (unbreakable space).
You will need enhanced version of mklivecd that is capable of using external
isolinux.cfg to use your translated isolinux.cfg on your live CD.
Although main menu is the most important part of the boot screen, there is more.
Other parts belong to gfxboot theme and are much more i18n friendly.
The best practice is to create your own gfxboot theme based on the default PCLOS
theme pclinuxos-gfxboot-theme. You will need to get the source package by
'apt-get source pclinuxos-gfxboot-theme'. Make a copy of source tree and change
it's name, SPEC file, etc. You need to know how to build RPMs. Interface
translations are in *.po files inside /po directory and help sources are in
files help-install.*.html (for Isolinux backend) or help-boot.*.html (for Grub
backend). Background image is in file back.jpg (Isolinux) or back-low.jpg (Grub).
Interface behaviour can be modified by editing the *.inc files but it's very
difficult because these source files are written in a strange programming
language similar to Postscript. Once you have create your customized gfxboot
theme, you can make a live CD to test it:

mklivecd --bootmenu /my/isolinux.cfg --boottheme myboottheme --bootlang cs ...
/tmp/mylivecd.iso

TO BE CONTINUED...

updated po/fr/drakconf.po
updated po/fr/libDrakX.po

both of these files had erroneous strings or misspeled words in the 
translated part.

Note for libdrakX.po

i added a string :

msgid "Select a graphical theme to display during boot"
msgstr ""

to all yet translated file ... please translate this line to get the 
translation up to the same level on every started po translation

the concerned teams are :

cs / hu / pl / pt_BR / pt_PT /

all other locale are still out of libDrakX.po ...

lets all go to work guys :)

consider processing those files as soon as possible since gettinther is 
adding the i18n core translation files to the distro ............. now !

team for such a contribution.
on the other hand. this is my pleasure to announce that gettinthe will
be soon able to provide you with localized rpms of the drakxtools for
you to betatest. so we are a few days away from the release of our
work in the mainstream ...

i will upload and make those files available later today for i'm not
at home ... anyway

thanks again.

i'm looking for youngblood to be added to the coder crew of livecd
project ... if anyone feels like getting involved ...

i'd be happy to register some new people with it

last point .

the cvs will be reorganised to fit better with system organisation ...
i'll come back to you with more infos about it
