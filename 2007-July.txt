yes we do have the same problem and those files are the one embedded in 
the pclinuxos release anyway !
as i said it before, you always can try but will never translate 
everything and maybe eaven if you manage to do it, you won't make it 
happen for long and will have to restart soonner or later.

when it comes to missing string, in translated softwares, once we've 
made our best to get the strings translated, there is a point at wich we 
need to drop it and focuss on the overall project and i do believe and i 
think you will agree with me that an untranslated string is less 
annoying than an untranslated software and that a 95% translated os is 
rather better than a 50% one ... we're doing our best to get it 
translated ... we can aim to 100% ... but we can't keep the developement 
of the softwares from rolling so we need to find limits to our ambition 
in order to achieve some goals ... one of those is to get pclinuxos to 
speak as fluently as possible in as many language as possible and not to 
limitate it's usage to anglo saxo linux junkies !

i think we're on the good track eaven if my beryl manager shows some 
untranslated strings !

Hi Didou,

By mistake I have canceled your reply concerning Beryl files translation problems. Would you be so kind to resend it to me?

My last mail was long but still lacking some very important information. Please do not think that I am not so naive to omit pclinuxos specific Beryl files when started my translations. I did it , of course, taking your French po as a format file. My reason for reaching Beryl site archive as my next step was only one: too many untranslated strings inside working Beryl Settings Manager in spite of my full translation of all four beryl po files. When I have translated beryl-plugins.po it was equal as yours but with so many English strings remaining that the rusult was quite unsatisfactory for me and I decided to do it once again with original po files downloaded from Beryl site. Now, with 1084 strings in beryl-plugin.po and 45 strings in beryl-settings.po my translation is much better. Still remains maybe 10% of strings in English but I am not able to do nothing more without any help from Beryl developers who know well the real reasons of such situation. I would like to stress as follows:  I have checked everything maybe about hundred times in KBabel and in working BSM the same. Therefore please do not expect from me to send you any other Beryl files. I could do it only after authors would correct their binary files duly to enable gettext to extract everything fully. Thus making translators able to do their job without fail. At present stage it is simply impossible.
In you reply you did not mention what happens when you are starting Beryl Settings Manager with your translated files into French. Have you also the same untranslated strings which I have mentioned in my last mail? Additionally I would like to inform you that in my BSM, exactly in its tab Extras>Window Previews there are all strings in English in spite of my full translation (those strings are inside beryl-plugins.po). Is it the same in your French BSM?

Best regards - Uznamer

Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] Translation of console commands help
Message-ID: <2f3d0f330707020541t1169d696n99dbe16c0069f25@mail.gmail.com>

Hi,

I don't know, but this step I think necessery to achieve more localized
distro. For this we need po's of glibc 2.4, utlil-linux2.12r, and coreutils
5.97 and some other small amount of files. But these 3 are the heart of
console system messages, and translated console helps. I hope these files
will be used up....

My problem is that: There are no correct glibc 2.4 pot anywhere. I have
older or newer one. Most of the packages are containing 2.2.5, 2.2.3, or
similar. Somebody has got glibc2.4 pot file?

On second: I checked coreutils, but the version doesn't match. In packages
are only 5.94 (in Mandrake 2007 Spring also!), and we need 5.97. Mostly the
5.94 enough.

For util-linux2.12r - I've got the proper one.

If anybody needs it I could send the pots or these po's.

thanks to all of you

a note for the translators ...

i'm happy to see that the flow of updates came back to its previous 
state, nevertheless, i think we should focuss a bit on our main goal. 
This goal is to translate pclinuxos, and not every single software that 
the linux world offers ... thus, i think that we should work on the 
translation yet open and started, finish them and then go back to 
fetching new ones ... i also think that we should focuss on the core 
files and softwares that makes pclos as it is and makes it gr8. so 
focussing on the linux kernel output messages during compilation are not 
must have for the average joe and thus are not necessary to be included 
in the cvs ... no ? i'm looking forward to read some feedback and 
comments on that point ...

anyway, in plain text, the holly bible is 1 mb big ... so i find it 
quite hillarious that the linux kernel po is 2 mb big :)

last but not least, remove version and country tags from your po 
submission file name. We only need the latest version and if you mention 
the locale in the mail , i'll obviously figure out the actual locale i 
must attach it to :) sometimes the version numbers/locale tag in 
filenames can be puzzeling and this lead me to test hell when i validate 
the file you submitted to me !

thanks for your attention

Didouph

ps, a version of synaptic wich will be fully (100%) localizable is under 
compilation ...

Message-ID: <468EB27D.9020803@laposte.net>

guys, here is an unnoficial po that ir required for immediate 
translation (as soon as possible please) to be added to the deviant 
(pclinuxos) version of synaptic wich will support more translation

return that pot file translated with your locale atached to it ... it 
won't be published/added to the CVS and should be considered as critical 
and 1st priority in all translation task by all team for wich the rest 
of synaptic's translation has yet been fullfilled !

Be so kind to replace that po at Polish section of cvs. In accordance with your request I did not marked it with version and localization. I am working now on compiz.po and will send you it very soon. There is a similar situation with updated libDrakX-standalone.po which has been translated earlier by Qla- our team member. I hope it would be completed till the end of this week.

Here is the first .desktop update, currently without dubi's new additions.
In the next mail will arrive the dubi's new desktop files additions, the
login-kdm parts, updated libdrakx.po. I do as I could, and mail it to you
asap.

embeded in this message you will see ANOTHER example of the submission 
syntax for desktop files

i converted latest submission to this format ... due to too many mistake 
in the orginal adressing, only 20% of the files got updated, also some 
entry listing empty files or duplicate entrys have been neglected in the 
late update...

example :

----------------------
adding Comment[hu]=Troff dokumentum to 
/home/didouph/Desktop/pclos-il8n/CVSROOT/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/message/x-troff.desktop
cat: 
/home/didouph/Desktop/pclos-il8n/CVSROOT/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/message/x-troff.desktop: 
No such file or directory
----------------------

there were about 250 lines to be updated out of about 10 000 and around 
250 files to update out of 1 500 in the cvs, do you think it's kind not 
to check if the adressing is correct before sending those to me for an 
update ?

On the other hand, just consider that despite the fact i spent 3 hours 
trying to figure out wich hu entry was the good one, i never figured one 
that sounded more appropriate to me ... i don't speak hungarian ...

anyway, next time i simply won't try to process the file. i don't think 
more explanations are needed, i've sent many warning about that before ...

ok ...

how to say that ...

i know this style of layout is pretty BORRING, but it helps figure out 
where are the problems in the files eaven if you don't speak the 
language since it would help me to batch process the files and find 
duplicates or missing entry ... if i need to do the pl myself (following 
file) it's just plain stupid .

USE THE FOLLOWING FORMAT !!

refer to the mailing list archive for more informations about it

it's addaline format ... don't tell me i wrote a program for nothing :)

i asked for your input and comment about this method but got none, i'll 
be glad to read from you if you disagree or dislike this submission 
policy. i think we all are open for subjestion ... if someone don't 
understand the content of a mail ... why not asking rather than doing 
nonsense and putting everyone into troubles !

sorry if i'm once again being hard to you despite the work you produce, 
but it's really time killing to go on like that and fix issues at random 
on aspect of the project that shouldn't need fixing ....

hi

first, i'd like to thanks you for all the work you've done

second, i'm not omniscient and they are some issue i cannot solve, let 
me check the other language's po i can find for compiz and i will tell you
anyway, maybe we simply should rename compiz to Gset-compiz to get it to 
work

third , if you have questions and answers, please use the list and not 
my email since i will be the only one aware about what is going on and i 
cannot deal with every single problem

i strongly recommend you to rely more on the help from one anothore and 
keep each other aware of what is going on, this is the purpose of this 
list, the usage isn't that hard, so try to keep things organised so we 
all understand what others are doing


final : does anyone managed to see if compiz is organized properly and 
translated
since it doesn't work on my computer, i don't know if it's translated 
properly

please answer this message at least whith a no since it would help to 
know if you all are still alive and working on the project !

The problems is that after converting it into compiz.mo and putting inside /usr/share/locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES folder then starting compiz manager there is NOTHING in Polish to read but English strings. Taking into account that compiz manager name is Gset-compiz I have checked if there is any po file inside gset-compiz_0.3.4.6pclos2007_i586.rpm I have found there is nothing to translate. Therefore I do not know what should be translated actually to get Gset-compiz to work in Polish? And second question is: what is compiz.po necessary for if its translation is doing nothing?

nothing is wrong with the mailing list, the messages require approval, 
that's it ... you just don't try, so your message aren't on the mailing 
list ...

"if at first you don't succedd, .. try again..."

the size of the atachement require sometimes (above 40k) a validation by 
the list owner ... me ... this is moderation... so you're registered, 
keep sending ...

anyway, your comments are listed and forwarded to the list, any comment 
or improvement about is welcome

uznamer at interia.pl )

i have no solution or answer !

i will investigate this issue anyway

maybe it's related to your smtp ?

Hi,

Many thanks for your prompt reply. My team fellow Qla just helped me to solve this problem. You did not notice that I was writting the wrong address. There is so small difference that it is really not easy to see it. As you surely know, shortage i18n means i-nternationalizatio-n (instead of 18 letters of nternationalizatio in the middle of this word). On the other hand l10n means l-okalizatio-n (the same pattern). Therefore how could I suppose that you have a mixture of both in your mailing list address? Instead of i18n you have il8n! The difference between letter "l" like love and number "1" meaning one is difficult to recognize when all letters are very small and your eyes are not so good. Never mind, the most important is that now everything has been cleared and I am sure that my following mails would reach you without fail.

Thanks and regards - Uznamer
