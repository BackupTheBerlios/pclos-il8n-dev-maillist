Are the file on the dvd the ones you created for the i18n team ( 

http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pclos-il8n/CVSROOT/po/sl) or 

other ones ?

If the files on the DVD are the ones you translated and forwarded to me 

on the mailing list, they will soon be added by gettingther in the main 

pclinuxos repository.



this is very important to make sure that the files you added for your 

localized iso are going to be taken in consideration by the i18n team 

since someone is moving the files from the i18n cvs to the pclos main 

branch. before this movement of file occurs, all your translation are 

weak against update and can go back to the stoopid look they had.



This is what i and a few other created the i18n team, to Block and force 

the integration of those files not to have to pick between english and 

stoopid translation but make a good translation of the os an offer it as 

replacement for the poor versions.



if you can confirm that those files you mentioned are identical on the 

dvd and on the page : 

http://cvs.berlios.de/cgi-bin/viewcvs.cgi/pclos-il8n/CVSROOT/po/sl



don't worry, your remaster is going to be a mainstream one !



i forward this message to the i18n team and some rippers...



cheers, didouph

Hi DidouPh,

here are the "molested" files. They are about 99% translated, except for
any.pm. There I've skipped some unused parts, e.g. Lilo section.

I'll ask the "new kid" to get in touch with you guys, so he can help with
the progress, and sync our project to yours.

Regards and good luck!

I am aware of the official localization project and I fully support the
idea.
My plan was first to make sure that we can really get the localization
project
going and that we have enough forces to get through before we join the
official
project at your side.
I think we are advancing quickly and we would be happy to join your ranks.

I know my packages cannot collide with the official ones. Therefore I never
make
updates of existing packages. Our mklivecd package has different name and
contains only the renamed skript, so it does not interfere with anything
else.
Of course, the possibility of pushing our changes upstream you are talking
about
is much better that this.

> anyways, if you could send me a documented version of your changes or at
> least a diff of those files so i could investigate the usage of those
> "molested" files for the team to use it ...

I'm sending you the patch against original mklivecd version.
There are three new options:

   --bootmenu <file>       What boot menu definition file should be used
                           in case that bootloader option is set to iso or
grub.
                           For iso this file must be named 'isolinux.cfg',
                           for grub the name must be 'menu.lst'.
                           Boot menu will be generated if not specified.

   --boottheme <name>      Which gfxboot theme should be used.
                           Defaults to 'pclinuxos'

   --bootlang <lang code>  Which language shound be used as default
                           in the boot menu.
                           Defaults to 'en'.

These options add flexibility to the mklivecd script - without them it
should
behave exactly the same as the original one.

I'm also sending you another patch - this one is for script /etc/rc.d/rc.
There is a overlooked limitation in the original script: when shutting down,
the
message "Shutting down the system...Press Esc for verbose mode" won't get
translated to language set in /etc/sysconfig/i18n. (In contrast with startup
message - here reinstalling bootsplash package is sufficient to get it
localized).
Packager of 'initscripts' package is Texstar. I wonder if you can persue him
to
incorporate this little change.

Hi

i will send your rc patch to tex as soon as i'll get it tested ...

i'm wondering if the mklivecd is that new as far as you can yet define the
bootmenu file, i used this hack to remaster the french pclinuxiso and
produced an automated script wich was interactivelly creating the remaster
... anyway this doesn't answer the issue since i need to test this too and
investigate the doc of mklivecd before i go deeper, i forward your patches
to both the i18n team and ikeres aswell as tom kelly (mklivecd developer)
they would both be happy to see evolution to the mklivecd thing since they
are looking for such ...

btw i'm wondering if you know how and could implement the usage of po/mo
files to get mklivecd localized and if you know how to change the keyboard
layout from initial boot ...

those two issues are connundrum eaven to ivan tom and i, if you find a way
to hack into it ... that would be nice to share your knowledge :)

I'm not quite sure I understand what you're talking about. We use the new
mklivecd in conjuction with our own boot theme based on 'pclinuxos' gfx boot
theme and with our own isolinux.cfg with menu labels translated to czech.
I even managed to get spaces into the labels - think that is normaly forbidden
in isolinux.cfg.
Our boot theme has slightly simplified options menu, our site url at lower right
corner of the background and last but not least, it has completely reworked help
contents. Although the original help was translated to many languages including
czech, it originated from Mandriva and thus totally out of reality.

Well, mklivecd was not written with internationalization in mind but it shoud
not be so hard to fix it.
All it takes is to carefully embrace all to-be-localized texts in N() function
call used by all Drak tools.

Example:
-------------------------
#!/usr/bin/perl

use lib qw(/usr/lib/libDrakX);

# Use "bootsplash" text domain, i.e. bootsplash.mo file
BEGIN { unshift @::textdomains, 'bootsplash' }

# Functions N and N_ are defined in this libDrakX module
use common;

# Print localized messages
print N("Booting the system...") . N("Press Esc for verbose mode.") . "\n";
--------------------------

Concerning the keyboard layout, there are two issues:
Keyboard layout active in the boot menu is defined by chosen language, you can
set the default boot menu language (and thus the default keyboard too) by using
the new mklivecd parameter --bootlang.
Keyboard layout in Linux is defined system-wide in file /etc/sysconfig/keyboard
and can be changed ad-hoc by command 'loadkeys'.

Regards,

David

BTW, could anybody please create the Czech forum and all the structures
necessary to include Czech language in the project ?

Hello,

Here is the czech (cs) version.

I found out that it's the author of program "finish-install" who is
responsible for this bug. This script is located in "standalone" group
of drak scripts but mistakenly uses "libDrakX" text domain, not
"libDrakX-standalone", where its phrases are located and translated.

guys, i think we need a better tool to carry-on our duty and a global
reorganisation. wile looking at the list of involved people, progress
yet reached and lack of track on what is goin on, that we all need a
common core and task list that we should use to balance the progress of
each very individual project ...

i will soon open a forum discussion about that but if any of you yet
have some proposal or suggestion to make about the current organisation
feel free to rise your voice and start it by yourself ...

i will also clean-up the current forum for archival soon.

Well, I haven't tried to contact anyone from the gang. I hope your message at
pclinuxos.com/forum will get some audience and we will have the answer soon.
Maybe the gang boys are busy right now.

This page might be helpful:
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_issue_tracking_systems
Also check the DCL project: http://dcl.sourceforge.net/

I think there is no point in translating things that are not intrinsic part of
PCLinuxOS. Packages like kde-i18n already have their distro-independent
maintainers and translators and trying to translate only their PCLOS variant is
quite inefficient and may become useless. Such translations should be
contributed directly to mantainers.

Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] Useful tool: completepo
Message-ID: <471C7A31.1000007@smidovi.eu>


Hello,

During translating drak tools to czech, this tool I wrote proved invaluable.
It can complete existing .po by adding untranslated phrases to it. It assumes
source files to be Perl scripts but that can be easily changed.
To use it, you will need source RPM package with base .po files and source
files. Source RPMs can be easily retrieved by command "apt-get source
<package_name>" after you have added at least one rpm-src mirror to your
sources.list. Then use Midnight commander (mc) to get inside and to unpack the
source from tarball.
If you need to find out what package owns particular file, use "rpm -qf
<complete_file_path>".


Usage: ./completepo <source po> [<target domain>] [<input files> ...]

Takes <source po> as a base, copies it to <target domain>.po, scans all <input
files> and adds found non-translated phrases to the end of <target domain>.po.

If you use only the first parameter, it scans the <source po> and creates file
<source po>.list containing paths to all input source files used to create this
.po file.
In the next run, you can only enter the first two parameters, <input files> will
be taken from file <source po>.list. Freely edit this file to make it match with
reality.



Example:

If directory tree looks like this:

po/*.po
drakmenustyle
...

Than you can enter:
completepo po/fr.po

That will create file "po/fr.po.list" containing only one line (because in this
example, there is only one source file) -
../drakmenustyle

Next command will be:
completepo po/fr.po drakmenustyle

Result of this will be the desired file drakmenustyle.po in the current
directory. Untranslated phrases used in the script "drakmenustyle" will be at
the end of the file.


I hope this can be somewhat useful.

David

Hello,

I just want to inform you that we've just released final version of
czech PCLOS remaster. Although I don't expect anyone of you can
understand czech, you may be interested in the screenshots here:
http://www.pclinuxos.cz/index.php?option=com_content&task=view&id=48&Itemid=1

We've gained plenty of experience during the development process and if
anyone is thinking about making national remaster, we are prepared to
share our tools and knowledge.

David
