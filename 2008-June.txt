Hi, guys!

It's been a while since last time! Today I tried to make the mkremaster 
script compatible with gettext. I think I managed.

With the second version of the script, nonetheless, I tried to 
substitute each variable name with %s (as it's usually found in the po), 
but still I get the real variable names in the pot file. Does anybody 
know the trick?

Then I will do liveusb.

Subject: [Pclos-il8n-dev] mkremaste, liveusb, gtk-liveinstall localization
Message-ID: <48576B4C.40205@fastwebnet.it>

Hi, guys!

I finished to implement gettext into important shell scripts: 
mkremaster, liveusb and the still-under-development gtk-liveinstall (a 
great one, imho). My implementation has been tested extensively, so 
there should be no bugs. I'm sending you the pot files and, by the way, 
also the italian translations (which you might use as a model). Be aware 
that whenever you see a $, that is a variable and shoud not be 
translated (like %s).

I'm sending you also the modified scripts, so that you can test your 
translations if you want. The original scripts are in usr/sbin, you just 
need to substitute them with the attached version and put your mo file 
(with the same name of the script) in your locale folder.

As for gtk-liveinstall, I recommend you to install the attached rpm, with

# rpm -ivh gtk-liveinstall-0.7.8-1iainrj2007.noarch.rpm

and then then substitute the script. Otherwise you need to put the 
script in \usr\sbin and, at the same time, create the folder 
/usr/share/gtk-liveinstall or it won't work completely.

iainrj asked for some help for creating the rpm of the international 
version. I've never done something like that, so I'm wondering if 
someone of you, especially David and didouph, can then package it.

That's it for now.

Bye!

Sorry for the late answer.
The trick is to use printf command instead of echo.

Example:

#!/bin/sh

. gettext.sh

export TEXTDOMAIN=command-not-found

shopt -u extquote

CACHE=/var/cache/cnf/cnfcache.sqlite

if [ -L "$0" ]
then
     if [ ! -r "$CACHE" ]
     then
	PATH="" exec $0
     fi

value like '%/bin/$COMMAND' or value like '%/sbin/$COMMAND' )"` )
     PACKAGES=( `sqlite3 $CACHE "select package_name from tag where name='files' 
and ( value like '%/bin/$COMMAND' or value like '%/sbin/$COMMAND' )"` )
     IFS=":" PATHLIST=( $PATH )

     for PROGRAM in "${PROGRAMS[@]}"
     do
	PROGDIR=`dirname $PROGRAM`
	FOUNDINPATH=`expr "$PATH" : ".*[:\A]\\($PROGDIR\\)[:\Z].*"`
	if [ -n "$FOUNDINPATH" -a -x "$PROGRAM" ]
	then
	    exec $PROGRAM $@
	fi
	if [ -x "$PROGRAM" ]
	then
	    printf $"Program \"%s\" is installed but is not in your PATH.\n" $PROGRAM
	    ISINSTALLED=1
	else
	    if [ -r "$PROGRAM" ]
	    then
		printf $"Program \"%s\" is installed but is not executable.\n" $PROGRAM
		ISINSTALLED=1
	    fi
	fi
     done

     if [ "$ISINSTALLED" == "1" ]
     then
	exit 127
     fi

     for PCK in ${PACKAGES[@]}
     do
	INSTALLED=`rpm -q $PCK`
	if [ "$?" == "0" ]
	then
	    RESULT=$?
	    break;
	fi
     done
     if [ "$RESULT" == "0" ]
     then
	printf $"The package containing \"%s\" is installed ( %s ), but the program is 
missing. Weird.\n" $COMMAND $INSTALLED
	exit 127
     fi
     printf $"Program \"%s\" is not installed.\n" $COMMAND
     ngettext "It's part of the following package:" "It's part of the following

	(
	printf $"Package:\t"
	sqlite3 $CACHE "select name,version,release,arch from package where name =

$1 "-" $2 "-" $3 "." $4}'
	printf $"Description:\t"
	sqlite3 $CACHE "select value from tag where name='summary' and package_name = 
'$PCK'"
	printf $"Install by typing:\t"
	printf "su -c 'apt-get install $PCK'\n"
	) | expand -t 25
     done
     echo "---------------------------------------------------------------------"
     exit 127
else
     printf $"This program should not be run directly.\n"
fi

Thank you, David, but I must be missing something since printf on its 
own does not include the gettext function.

Am I wrong? I tryed a simple experiment and I didn't get any translation.

printf is just a command that uses C-like syntax for messages.

The $"..." construct is a BASH shorthand for gettext call, similiar to `gettext 
\"...\"` but shorter

Thank you, David.

My experiment didn't work because with

gettext -e "Hello\nworld" the template string is "Hello\nworld", while with

printf $"Hello\nworld" the template string becomes "Hello\\nworld"

do you think I should change the scripts for using this syntax?

Not related to this topic... I'd like to prepare pot and po of the new 
*drak* utilities (see 
http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=2133.0). Can you give 
me some advice, direction, any information you think it's important?
Unless you want to do this job. Then I step back.

I don't think so. Even gettext authors do not recommend the $"..." syntax.
But next time you can try something like this:

  printf "`gettext "File %s was deleted\n"`" $FILE

in order to have better looking msgids.

David, aesthetics is important also to me and I want to redo everything 
to make it look better.

I've finally realized how initscripts get localized and I will implement 
that system into my script modifications. It's very simple, you just 
need such a function:

gprintf() {
        local TEXT=`gettext -e "$1"`
    shift
    printf "$TEXT" "$@"
}

Then you use it like this:

gprintf "Hello\nworld"; echo
echo
NAME=Alessio
SURNAME=Adamo
echo "$(gprintf "Surname: \"%s\"\nName: \"%s\"\n" $SURNAME $NAME)"

I've tested it and it works flawlessly.

In addition, there's no need to call gettext.sh so that the gettext-base 
package is enough (we get rid of a dependency). Finally, in the message 
id you can remove the ugly \\n, \\t, \\\" and substitute them with 
prettier \n, \t, \"

Regards,
Alessio

The problem was that the Name and Comment translations were mixed in the 
.desktop files. I had to sort them prior to processing in make_intltool_ready 
script.

I've put experimental desktop-files.in tree into CVS repository, this tree is a 
result of launching make_intltool_ready and make_intltool_update scripts.
You can also find updated scripts in the root of this tree.
I believe this setup will make translating .desktop files much easier and more 
reliable.

The .pot files can be produced by using Makefiles present in drakxtools SRPM.
There's no need to manually scan the sources, intltool will do it for you.

SRPM is always a good start when trying to localize or update localization of 
package.

Due to recent issues with the head of mypclinuxos, i'm no longer in charge
of administration there.
Unless you agee (all) to a big move for our forums and future base (wich
doesn't mean no more collaboration with mypclinuxos projects) out of this
portal, i will give my resignation from this project lead and transfer my
duties to anyone willing to carry it on.

I don't want to discuss or motivate the reason that led to such a decision.
I just want to let you know that this doesn't cancel any hoosting i'm
providing to any "sub" project.

no response will result in my resignatin within the next 24 hours.

sorry

good week-end (anyway)

Thank you, David. I've been busy reimplementing printf in the scripts in 
order to have nice messages with %s instead of the name of the 
variables. The new scripts and messages are ready, but now I've to go to 
bed (waking up very early tomorrow). I'll send them tomorrow or on 
Wednesday. Then I'll work on the *drak* localization.

Hi, David!


This the new version of the pot and italian po + scripts. Now they don't 
need the gettext package, gettext-base is enough. Moreover variables are 
in the form of %s.

You can delete

/other/usr/sbin/mkremaster2

The desktop file is OK. It's what gtk-liveinstall does.


Thanks, Alessio

Guys,

I've started to produce the new drak utilities po files. At the moment 
just userdrake, drakconf, drakmenustyle and draklive-install, for all 
the available languages. The po files contain the original messages 
(from Mandriva translators), so some PCLOS specific messages might be 
fuzzy or untranslated. Check them out.
Moreover, if you customized the previous translation of these tools and 
you want to keep it, you can use the following command:

msgmerge --update oldpofile.po newpotfile.pot

all the matching messages will be retrieved from the old po file.

Soon other files will come.

;-)

Alessio

To the CVS maintainers: I suggest to put them in a new folder, like po2008
