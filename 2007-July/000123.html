<PRE>yes we do have the same problem and those files are the one embedded in 
the pclinuxos release anyway !
as i said it before, you always can try but will never translate 
everything and maybe eaven if you manage to do it, you won't make it 
happen for long and will have to restart soonner or later.

when it comes to missing string, in translated softwares, once we've 
made our best to get the strings translated, there is a point at wich we 
need to drop it and focuss on the overall project and i do believe and i 
think you will agree with me that an untranslated string is less 
annoying than an untranslated software and that a 95% translated os is 
rather better than a 50% one ... we're doing our best to get it 
translated ... we can aim to 100% ... but we can't keep the developement 
of the softwares from rolling so we need to find limits to our ambition 
in order to achieve some goals ... one of those is to get pclinuxos to 
speak as fluently as possible in as many language as possible and not to 
limitate it's usage to anglo saxo linux junkies !

i think we're on the good track eaven if my beryl manager shows some 
untranslated strings !

Hi Didou,

By mistake I have canceled your reply concerning Beryl files translation problems. Would you be so kind to resend it to me?

My last mail was long but still lacking some very important information. Please do not think that I am not so naive to omit pclinuxos specific Beryl files when started my translations. I did it , of course, taking your French po as a format file. My reason for reaching Beryl site archive as my next step was only one: too many untranslated strings inside working Beryl Settings Manager in spite of my full translation of all four beryl po files. When I have translated beryl-plugins.po it was equal as yours but with so many English strings remaining that the rusult was quite unsatisfactory for me and I decided to do it once again with original po files downloaded from Beryl site. Now, with 1084 strings in beryl-plugin.po and 45 strings in beryl-settings.po my translation is much better. Still remains maybe 10% of strings in English but I am not able to do nothing more without any help from Beryl developers who know well the real reasons of such situation. I would like to stress as follows:  I have checked everything maybe about hundred times in KBabel and in working BSM the same. Therefore please do not expect from me to send you any other Beryl files. I could do it only after authors would correct their binary files duly to enable gettext to extract everything fully. Thus making translators able to do their job without fail. At present stage it is simply impossible.
In you reply you did not mention what happens when you are starting Beryl Settings Manager with your translated files into French. Have you also the same untranslated strings which I have mentioned in my last mail? Additionally I would like to inform you that in my BSM, exactly in its tab Extras&gt;Window Previews there are all strings in English in spite of my full translation (those strings are inside beryl-plugins.po). Is it the same in your French BSM?

Best regards - Uznamer
