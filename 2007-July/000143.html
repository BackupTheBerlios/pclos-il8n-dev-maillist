<PRE>hi

first, i'd like to thanks you for all the work you've done

second, i'm not omniscient and they are some issue i cannot solve, let 
me check the other language's po i can find for compiz and i will tell you
anyway, maybe we simply should rename compiz to Gset-compiz to get it to 
work

third , if you have questions and answers, please use the list and not 
my email since i will be the only one aware about what is going on and i 
cannot deal with every single problem

i strongly recommend you to rely more on the help from one anothore and 
keep each other aware of what is going on, this is the purpose of this 
list, the usage isn't that hard, so try to keep things organised so we 
all understand what others are doing


final : does anyone managed to see if compiz is organized properly and 
translated
since it doesn't work on my computer, i don't know if it's translated 
properly

please answer this message at least whith a no since it would help to 
know if you all are still alive and working on the project !

</I>&gt;<i> You will find enclosed compiz.po localized in Polish. Anyway I should stress that it is still useless due to unknown reasons, maybe similar like it was in case of beryl files. I mentioned it already in my earlier mail containing beryl localized files. The problems is that after converting it into compiz.mo and putting inside /usr/share/locale/pl/LC_MESSAGES folder then starting compiz manager there is NOTHING in Polish to read but English strings. Taking into account that compiz manager name is Gset-compiz I have checked if there is any po file inside gset-compiz_0.3.4.6pclos2007_i586.rpm I have found there is nothing to translate. Therefore I do not know what should be translated actually to get Gset-compiz to work in Polish? And second question is: what is compiz.po necessary for if its translation is doing nothing?
