Hi Didou,

Enclosed you will find four beryl files which I have just translated into Polish plus emerald.po. It was really hard work to accomplish. Actually I was the second translator, not the first one for Polish localization. Nevertheless I corrected many fuzzy or improper translations and added a really huge amount of not translated positions. The final result is still not satisfactory due to strange problems with many words which do not want to appear in Polish in spite of translating them duly using KBabel. All concerned files have been downloaded from original Beryl archives and fully updated using intltools-update pl command at console. I suppose that remaining English words in translated po files it is common problem for all localizations. Therefore I am really surprised there is no information about it till now at our localization forum or mailing-list. A few days ago I have sent a mail to Beryl developers advising them about translation problems and have got a reply which does not explain actually nothing how to solve them. Anyway it is very interesting because maybe my (pardon, our) efforts are useless taking into account that Beryl would be only history soon and we will be forced to start again with translating a new 3D Desktop Manager named Compiz-Fusion.

Below you will find my mail and reply from Beryl i18n team head (Jigish 'CyberOrg' Gohil) as I would like to avoid repeating to write the same thing twice:

Would be nice to hear from you what do you think about it?

Best regards - Uznamer

Hi Uznamer

Thanks for your email.

Bery-settings translations will soon be useless as you fear.

We are in the process of merge as you know, currently we do not have
proper translation mechanism in place, we are discussing various ways
we can do it, you can see the information about the suggestion here:

Please join the discussion and put down your suggestions on obby.

Thanks again

</I>&gt;<i> Hi,
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> My nick is Uznamer. I am a member of PCLinuxOS Polish localization team.
</I>I
&gt;<i> have already translated all Beryl po files. Of course, I am not at your
</I>&gt;<i> list of translators. The first Polish translator was Piotr Drag as you
</I>&gt;<i> maybe know. The problem is that he has translated beryl-plugins.po
</I>which
&gt;<i> has only 867 positions while other national translators had translated
</I>&gt;<i> their po files with many more positions. Most of them 1006 positions
</I>and some
&gt;<i> of them (Spanish one for example) even 1248. It is impossible to
</I>&gt;<i> understand how it could happen. In my opinion they should be all the
</I>same.
&gt;<i> Am I wrong? Taking it into account I have updated beryl-settings.po
</I>with intltool-update pl_PL command and have got the pot file with 1084
positions inside. Aftre translating it fully the result could be checked 
after starting Beryl
&gt;<i> Settings Manager. Now it looks almost like full translated into Polish.
</I>&gt;<i> Anyway it does not mean that everything is already OK. We have still
</I>many
&gt;<i> English words inside it in spite of being previously completely
</I>&gt;<i> translated. Even worse, there are just at the beginning of Manager, at
</I>his
&gt;<i> first page, so say. I mean there are General Options and its tabs like
</I>&gt;<i> Shortcuts; Settings, Profiles and Desktop Integration, everything still
</I>in
&gt;<i>  English. Also in the whole Manager there are not coming out in Polish
</I>such
&gt;<i> a words like: shortcuts, advanced, disabled, button etc. There is no
</I>&gt;<i> possibility to force them appear as Polish words in spite of the fact
</I>that
&gt;<i> they have been properly translated with a help of Kbabel.
</I>&gt;<i> The special case is with the subtitle in General Options which says:
</I>&gt;<i> 'Beryl Core Options - Options.... which are the part of the core
</I>of
&gt;<i> beryl, and are not a part of the plugins. I did not found it in
</I>any
&gt;<i> of Beryl po files! You can found it only inside the binary
</I>beryl-settings file
&gt;<i> at /usr/bin address. There is also one tab inside Extras, named Window
</I>&gt;<i> Previews where everything remains in English after translation. I
</I>suppose
&gt;<i> you can agree that such a translation for any user who does not know
</I>&gt;<i> English at all is really annoying.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> I am full aware that Beryl is merging now with Compiz and becoming
</I>&gt;<i> Compiz-Fusion. Does it mean that its translation would be useless soon?
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Please be so kind to advise what should I do to solve that problem or
</I>when
&gt;<i> I could find such advise if it was already mentioned anywhere.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> Best regards - Uznamer
</I>
&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i>PS - My files have 1.4 or 1.5 version number. They have been numbered such way for our Polish team inner needs. Maybe I should renumber them duly into v.1.1 when sending them to you? Because it is actually the first version I am sending there.
