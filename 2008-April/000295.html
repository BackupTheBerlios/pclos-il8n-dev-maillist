<PRE>pierre-henri-ramboz napsal(a):
&gt;<i> @ David ... what are your reactions to the mail i yet sent about the 
</I>&gt;<i> tools you designed to manage desktop files ?
</I>
I'm afraid I didn't receive any e-mail from you since April 14th ...
Could you resend it ?


&gt;<i> what framework would you introduce to facilitate the translation process 
</I>&gt;<i> with new/recently/to-be programs that will need translation of the 
</I>&gt;<i> desktop files ?
</I>&gt;<i> i think that you've created something nice but we need to learn how to 
</I>&gt;<i> master it. powerfull tools are only usefull in masters hand!
</I>
I don't know if I understand it right but I'll try to answer:

I think that the software author should be responsible for i18n. He/she should 
provide framework for managing translations. We all know that this is not how it 
works in real world. In cases when l10n is not a part of the program build 
process all we can do is to provide a patch with translated .desktop file.
For such project I would recommend just to add their .desktop file to our tree 
and run make_intltool_update script. If we need the true blue .desktop file with 
translations for such project (we need to prepare patch for SRPM) - just launch 
script build_desktop_files.
If, on the other side, we can change the software build process to some extent, 
the best way is to have .desktop.in file as a source and to build a .desktop 
file from it and from the .po files during the build process. All you need for 
this is the intltool-merge utility (see VIT SRPM for example).
Mature projects usually already have such .desktop file compilation in their 
build process.
The important thing is that .desktop.in file is the real source file - .desktop 
file can be &quot;cooked&quot; any time from it if you have translations.

This is rather complex issue and to find a complete solution I would need to 
examine the problem a little more and to answer few questions:

How do the translated .desktop files get into official packages now ?
Isn't it too labour-intensive ?
Should we provide some patch-making infrastructure ?
Or should we just make one-for-all package from our .desktop files rather than 
injecting them into individual packages ?


&gt;<i> what about that livecd i18n team / project ?
</I>
I think it's a good idea but where would it be hosted ? If I understood it 
right, mypclinuxos.com is shutting down soon ...

David
