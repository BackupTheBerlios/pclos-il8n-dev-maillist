Hello everybody!

Last time I've sent the italian synaptic_update.po with the wrong charset. This 
time it's written in the correct utf-8 charset.

I've also amended the main synaptic.po file. Indeed, I had noticed that the ital
ian version already in the CVS had some missing or fuzzy translations. Moreover,
 when compared to the french version, it was noticeable that also some original 
messages were missing. Therefore I decided to integrate it and revise it. Now it
's colinear with the french version.

;-)

Take care!

right

but you also could use cervisa and then be able late in the future to 
monitor changes from your local folder and the whole cvs three

if i where you i would :

get the whole three copyed to my desktop
seek for missing files in my locale install
check against what is in /po/fr and /po/hu
then translate the from fr or hu po files translate to swedish

they are some files in the pot directory that are critical to the sstem 
core translation, those files are :
synaptic-update.pot and vit.pot
both are part of default pclinuxinstall and are basis for translation
synaptic-update is bound to be used as a patch on the synaptic.po 
located in the fr section of po module.

also consider that the first translation to make are the drak tool's 
ones so if you need a roadmap, you could :

1 : translate vit synaptic and synaptic-update
2 : translate bootsplash.po drakconf.po draklive-install.po 
drakmenustyle.po libDrakX.po libDrakX-standalone.po userdrake.po
3 : and now go on with desktop files !

kbabel is better for bigginers
don't forget your credit and e.mail

yes

if you send a bundle of file, you may simply add the locale code to the 
tar.gz no need to add it to every files

i created the sv_SE directory on the cvs three !

have fun

Hi, everybody!

As I mentioned in my previous e-mail, I realised that I was using a wrong proced
ure to download files from the CVS. As a consequence of it, html code was added 
to them.
Two po files affected by it
synaptic.po
tightvnc.po
were corrected.
At the same time I corrected a spelling mistake in draklive-install.po

Thank you for patience,

Message-ID: <47F5D56B.8080304@smidovi.eu>

Hello,

There is an update of vit in testing on PASS - the only change in it is renaming 
ati_7x driver to ati_8x, so I dared to make all the changes in po files by 
myself. If these po files are OK, I'll include them in the next vit release.
Concerning the Italian translation: I had to convert the DOS ends of lines to 
UNIX ones and I've also added a descriptive header to the po file.

In attachment you will also find a set of .po files generated from an updated 
apt package. All the translations need to be completed.

Message-ID: <22d880e20804050452v50a4b512g7e8fabb269d667db@mail.gmail.com>

Hello everyone!

Let's see if I got this right. Start with two not so major swedish
translated po files:

/po/sv_SE/bootsplash.po
/po/sv_SE/vit.po

I am not sure how the rest of you do it, but I have a feeling I lack a
"testing procedure" where I actually can bring these translations into an
install and make sure translations were interpreted correctly in their true
situation, before submitting them. As it is now, I am studying procedures
and apps and twist and turn some translations quite a bit, without slight
clue how it actually will turn out when applied. Maybe this is something
normal  :D

Hope they are not contaminated with some html etc (hence starting out with 2
small translations and iron out possible mistakes in my procedure before I
get too far in the much larger synaptic.po I work on at the moment). I
brought them down via Cervisia and not command line CVS so there are
possible new room for glitches (unknown fact to me though).

I am sure however most of you can tell at once by just looking at for
example vit.po if there is something not like it should.

Anyhow. Currently working on synaptic.po [sv_SE].

Regards

In mcedit DOS ends of lines are visible as ^M. In KWrite you can take
look what option is checked in "Tools->End of Line". This submenu can be
also used to replace DOS ends of lines to the UNIX ones. Or you can use
dos2unix utility.

Testing the translation is quite easy - just compile it by typing:

msgfmt vit.po -o vit.mo

Then copy the file vit.mo to directory
/usr/share/locale/sv_SE/LC_MESSAGES/ and launch vit to check it - it
should talk to you in your language.
It the case of vit, you need version vit-1.1 from testing, former
versions are not internationalized.
This procedure is universal and should work for all internationalized
applications.

Hi, everybody!

I was translating both in Windows and in PCLOS and I wasn't aware of the Linux/D
OS end of lines. I found in poEdit the option to convert to Linux ends. So I con
verted all po(s). Meanwhile I profited to edit the headers and do some minor cor
rections.

I attach also the fist part of desktop files, to make DidouPh's life easier. Ano
ther part will come soon.

Early next week, instead, I'll send the italian default home page and the italia
n guide for installation.

Have a nice weekend!

it rings my bell about the wiki ... i almost forgot about it and didn't

that would be highly apreciated :)

Hello all,

I've cleaned up all vit translations using msgmerge:

msgmerge -U --backup=simple cs.po vit.pot

This way I've added new messages from vit.pot to all .po files and
messages not used anymore in vit have been commented out.

There are two new messages in .po files: VIT desktop icon name and
comment. So, if you want to translate vit .desktop file texts to your
language, just grab your .po file and fill in the msgstrs. I'm going to
release a new vit version soon.

Worked like a charm. However I am in confusion since update of
/po/sv_SE/vit.po 1.2.
I noticed that the section "ATI 7X" was replaced by "ATI 8X". That is what
is shown in vit.po when looking at it and editing it with Kbabel. I thought
it was ok with the 1.2 I submitted today. I compiled it into vit.mo and
copied it to the location over the other. Then started up vit 1.1 etc.
To my surprise I notice that there are no tab with "ATI 8X". And the tab
"ATI 7X" is still there.. and what is more.. the section with it has 50%
parts that isn't translated.
Very weird since there are no "ATI 7X" showing at any ID in Kbabel.

Going to look at vit.po with standard text editor no and try figure out if
something is wrong. Feel kinda wrong to have untranslated parts in program,
but not in Kbabel ^^

Hi, guys!

It's the italian translator typing!

Here you get the last vit updated version, the welcome webpage and the installat
ion help plus screenshots.

Before I leave you... I noticed that in vit there is a typo in an original messa
ge, the one describing the Nvidia 169.xx driver. PLESE instead of PLEASE. ;-)

the framework used to translate string using po files in sftwares like 
vit only translate what is translated in the po file ... in your 
personal situation, the po file containing the 8x string was considered 
as lacking the 7x string to the framework (gettext) let the original 
english version of the string in place. the same would have happened if 
you had 1.2 version of vit instaled wile using the 1.1 version of the po 
... you would have been able to read the strings in english but not in 
sv when looking at 8X tab ...

this is the strenght and weakness of this system ... al translations are 
not necessary, but a tiny change of 1 digit in the original code can 
result in untranslated strings.

Thanks for the report, I will wait two days for any additional vit l10n updates 
with .desktop texts translations and then I'll fix that typo in all .po files 
and in the VIT script itself.
That means on Wednesday I'm going to release a new VIT version.

hi arthurg

thanks for your effort in translating pclinuxos

about grub,

i checked grub source and it seems there is no i18n framework for it
BUT : if you have a look at isolinux folder on a livecd, you may fing 
XX.tr and XX.hlp wich are used to translate the bootloader in accordance 
with the locale mentioned as "XX" on the other hand, you have a 
bootsplash.po that translate the initial screens after grub ... but i 
personally have no idea where the isolinux files need to be placed 
except for the livecd ...

so yes things are missing, but i don't know if it is a po or something else.

understanding how things works helps a lot in doing a clean translation 
... our work here is not only in translating strings of text from one 
language to another but also document the process of translating the 
system widely, including keyboard and aspect to facilitate every single 
regional specification.

why don't you ask some more question and we will see if we can help you 
more... we also would be pleased to see the result/output of the 
chionese team on the pclos-il8n dev list so it could be added to the cvs 
and pushed into mainstream.

feel free to register on the pclos-il8n-dev at lists.berlios.de list... 
thus all team members will be able to answer to your questions ... i 
don't have all answers :)

I know pretty much about Grub and Isolinux localization (in fact it's a matter 
of GfxBoot, which is loosely coupled with both of these boot loaders)

I've also sent two fragments of "Language Localized Remaster HOWTO" that were 
dealing with GfxBoot here in the maillist before I gave up due to lack of time 
and feedback.

hi david

i remember you did but still never got answer to request for adding it 
to the wiki ... :)

things need to be public in order to be accessed ... we don't do things 
for us but the community ...

anyway the process of translating grub is kind of different than the 
rest of the system ... it would be nice to investigate this a bit deeper 
and evbentually to hack into it for better user experience , why not 
starting a chil project to the i18n related to language friendliness of 
the bootloader, that you could "moderate" ?

in order to show you that at least one person cared about your work (and 
still does) i atached the howto you wrote to this mail...

thanks again for it david

If I remember it right I think I didn't know the "whereabouts" concerning wiki 
access and then it somehow evaporated from my mind...
Wiki is definitely the best media format for such things.

Why not, but where would be such project based, now when mypclinuxos.com is 
closing down ?

Message-ID: <47FF03E9.5020903@smidovi.eu>

Hello all,

I've sent to Textstar new VIT release 1.1-4 yesterday. It contains all the 
updated translations and I also fixed the "PLESE" typo in the script and all the 
.po files.

I'm also attaching Czech translation and the .pot file of command-not-found 
utility (my creation). Only a few messages.


command-not-found:
-----------------

Tool that informs PCLinuxOS user about missing program availability.
This utility was inspired by Ubuntu's command-not-found package but it's
implemented in a different way.

Example:

[root at localhost /]# vit
Program "vit" is not installed.
It's part of the following package:
---------------------------------------------------------------------
Package:                 vit-1.1-1pclos2007.noarch
Description:             Video Installation Tool for ATI & Nvidia
Install by typing:       su -c 'apt-get install vit'

Hi, David!

It's great news that we can have a "command not found" message in our languages!

However I didn't get any attachment. Did you forget it?

I certainly did not forget it. It must be the mailing list eating attachments.
I'll send a copy of this mail including those attachments to your email address.

Thank you, David, this time I've got the attachments.

However that vit update resembles the version we had before you commented out so
me messages and added the lines for the .desktop file. Is this really the final 
version?

I'm asking you because, if this is the case, in this version of the italian po, 
there are some mistakes that I'd like to correct.

I used the most recent version I could reach - the one you've sent to
this list on April 6th, 23:24 in message labeled "[it][new stuff]"

Is there any newer version ?

Hi, David!

The last [it]vit is already uploaded into the CVS and it is different from the o
ne you sent. However I'm sending it again because I discovered a typo (69 instea
d of 169).

I'm attaching also the [it]command-not-found.po
Be aware, though, that one message is duplicated, precisely: "Install by typing:
\\t"

Going to bed, now

Bye!

I don't know what is in the CVS because I can't get there right now.
I used translation you've sent on April 6th, 23:24 and I fixed the PLESE
typo. In fact, I fixed this type in ALL translation. That's the only
difference.


> I'm attaching also the [it]command-not-found.po

OK. I've sent on contribs new vit and command-not-found releases
containing you're updates. Just please fix that PLESE typo on your side
or grab the vit.po file I'm sending to stay synchronized.

I've also fixed that duplicated message problem in command-not-found.pot

Hello, guys!

I'm finally starting to see the light at the end of the tunnel. The translation 
of the desktop files is almost complete, only the mimelnk directory is missing (
still a lot of work, actually... ARGH!!!)

Please, note that last time the .directory files in /root/Documents; /root/Music
; /root/Movies and /root/Pictures didn't get updated, so I'm sending them again.

Note also that in the CVS, in 

desktop-files/usr/share/desktop-directories

the hungarian translation for mandriva-moreapplications-editors.directory and fo
r mandriva-moreapplications-other.directory was in a separated text file. I've i
ntegrated the strings in the proper .directory file, so now the text files can b
e deleted.

At the same time I'm sending again the xml file for the KDM Dark theme, correcte
d not to display the login information. So now background-it.png in that folder 
can be deleted.

Hi, Didouph!

In the last tarball I sent you there were also the following hidden files:

/root/Movies/.directory
/root/Pictures/.directory
/root/Documents/.directory
/root/Music/.directory

These were not updated. You can either find them in my previous e-mail or just c

/etc/skel/Movies 

and so on

Hi!

I have a humble request about a "Swedish (Svenska)" forum section to be
added under /Localization/ at MyPCLinuxOS; A place where I can add
translation dictionary lists and other usefull information for a hopefully
larger Swedish translation team in the future and all that makes it easier
for others to enter project. :)

Hi, guys!

I've made some minor corrections to 3 po files and started to work at apt.po
I'm sending you the most up to date file.

Hi, everybody!

Fresh translations of desktop files today! Only the mimelnk files were missing a
nd translation is proceeding quickly. At the moment I've translated all files in
 the following folders:
/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/application
/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/audio
/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/text
/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/video
(/desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/inode contains only one element which has alre
ady the italian translation)
I've sent only the files which needed modifications.
_______________________________
Meanwhile, I'd like to report that there is a bit of mess in the CVS, I think (e
specially with hungarian translations). Let me explain:

Folder /desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/application

In some cases the hungarian translation is in a file with a single line (therefo
re an incorrect desktop file) which is a duplicate of a proper desktop file:

andrew-inset.desktop
x-applix-spread (the correct one is x-applixspread.desktop)
x-applixword.desktop
x-catalog.desktop (the correct one is x-katalog.desktop)
x-reject (the correct one is x-reject.desktop)
x-theme.desktop

In all these cases, I've pasted the hungarian translation in the correct copy. S
o, the wrong one can be deleted without pity.

Then, the following pairs of mimetype refer to the same extension. Is it OK?

x-applixspread.desktop/x-applixspreadsheet.desktop
x-applix-word.desktop/x-applixword.desktop
x-object-file.desktop/x-object.desktop

If one of each has to be eliminated, I would delete that with less translations.

Finally x-sharedlib.desktop seems to refer to the same file type as x-sharedlibr
ary.desktop, but it has no argument in the line pattern=.


Folder /desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/message

This folder does not contain proper mimetype desktop files. Again, these files j
ust contain a line with a hungarian comment. However, I've noticed that they are
 duplicated in /desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/text and that the copies lack th
e hungarian translation. Therefore, I added the hungarian comments found in [...
]/message to the desktop files in [...]/text.

Nonetheless, x-gnu-rmail.desktop is only present in [...]/message and is an inco
rrect desktop file

I hope it is clear enough.
_______________________________
Now the italian translation is almost complete. Only folder /desktop-files/usr/s
hare/mimelnk/image is missing, plus apt.po. But this is not that essential, I gu
ess. You can't imagine how happy I am.

Take care,
Alessio

I think the desktop-files tree is a real mess. Translating .desktop files this 
way is a suicide. This task must be done by strictly dividing original desktop 
files and localizations. I think intltool is a proper tool for doing this.

I sat down and wrote some scripts that make the transition easy.

Script make_intltool_ready first corrects lots of problems found in current 
.desktop files, then calls intltool-prepare to generate the infrastructure.
Then intltool-update is used to generate the desktop-files.pot file and finally 
all locales are processed to contain all available msgids.
At the end, there should be NO files with .desktop extension, only files with 
.desktop.in extension. These files do not contain any translations, all the 
translations are in po/$LOCALE.po files.

If you have a new .desktop file and want to add it, just place it on proper 
location and call the second script - make_intltool_update. That script should 
incorporate all messages from that new .desktop file into existing .po files, 
updates desktop-files.pot and converts that new .desktop file into new 
.desktop.in file.

And last but not least, if you want to build the real .desktop files with 
current translations, just call the third script - build_desktop_files.
This script should generate complete desktop-file tree into directory 
../desktop-files-build. This tree contains only the real .desktop files with 
translations.


Please note that you have to install intltool package before launching the scripts.

Hi, guys!

Today I've finished the translation of all the mimelnk files. This batch goes to
 /desktop-files/usr/share/mimelnk/image.

Also in this directory there is an improper file with the hungarian comment only
, which I pasted in the correct one:

x-windowdump.desktop (wrong) / x-xwindowdump.desktop (correct)

In addition there are in some cases files which refer to the same mime. I'll omi
t .desktop:

x-djvu-2 / x-djvu
x-portable-graymap / x-portable-greymap
x-targa / x-tga
x-xbitmap / x-xbm
x-xcf / x-xcf-gimp
jpeg / jpg
psd / x-vnd.adobe.photoshop

svg-xml lacks a line patterns= and maybe it would be the same as svg+xml

wmf also laks a line patterns= I didn't take a note if there was another file re
ferring di Windows Meta File, though.

Tomorrow I'm leaving for Leeds (UK) and I won't be much available for translatin
g for about 1 month. However, the most is done. Only apt.po is missing. I hope s
oon we'll have a multilanguage DVD.

Bye!

Hello all,

I revised the VIT package a little bit to be easier to update without the need 
to update all translations after every little change.

All the data that are often changing are now parametrized.

Please take a look at the .po files, they should be OK but I might have 
overlooked something.

yes sorry i'm pretty busy at work right now ...

@ cryoniq ... can you tel me wich po and eventually resent them in a 
single tar.gz archive and i will se if i yet added them to the cvs (my 
local copy should be identical to online cvs but i could be wrong and 
cvs demon could be too ... since i doublechecked all the submissions 
you've made ... its kind of puzzeling ...

once again resend the files here and i'll add them

@ David ... what are your reactions to the mail i yet sent about the 
tools you designed to manage desktop files ?
what framework would you introduce to facilitate the translation process 
with new/recently/to-be programs that will need translation of the 
desktop files ?
i think that you've created something nice but we need to learn how to 
master it. powerfull tools are only usefull in masters hand!

what about that livecd i18n team / project ?

anyway i will forward your latest additions to the cvs assap


@ alessio i will subit your updates to the CVS real soon (maybe in a few 
minutes)

I'm afraid I didn't receive any e-mail from you since April 14th ...
Could you resend it ?

I don't know if I understand it right but I'll try to answer:

I think that the software author should be responsible for i18n. He/she should 
provide framework for managing translations. We all know that this is not how it 
works in real world. In cases when l10n is not a part of the program build 
process all we can do is to provide a patch with translated .desktop file.
For such project I would recommend just to add their .desktop file to our tree 
and run make_intltool_update script. If we need the true blue .desktop file with 
translations for such project (we need to prepare patch for SRPM) - just launch 
script build_desktop_files.
If, on the other side, we can change the software build process to some extent, 
the best way is to have .desktop.in file as a source and to build a .desktop 
file from it and from the .po files during the build process. All you need for 
this is the intltool-merge utility (see VIT SRPM for example).
Mature projects usually already have such .desktop file compilation in their 
build process.
The important thing is that .desktop.in file is the real source file - .desktop 
file can be "cooked" any time from it if you have translations.

This is rather complex issue and to find a complete solution I would need to 
examine the problem a little more and to answer few questions:

How do the translated .desktop files get into official packages now ?
Isn't it too labour-intensive ?
Should we provide some patch-making infrastructure ?
Or should we just make one-for-all package from our .desktop files rather than 
injecting them into individual packages ?


> what about that livecd i18n team / project ?

I think it's a good idea but where would it be hosted ? If I understood it 
right, mypclinuxos.com is shutting down soon ...

David
