&gt;<i> hi,

</I>&gt;<i> There is an &quot;international&quot; localization effort based @ mypclinuxos.com
</I>&gt;<i> &lt;<A HREF="http://mypclinuxos.com">http://mypclinuxos.com</A>&gt;

</I>&gt;<i> you guessed that i would be happy to have you being part of this
</I>&gt;<i> project. the enhancements you made for czeck language should be shared
</I>&gt;<i> by everyone.
</I>
I am aware of the official localization project and I fully support the
idea.
My plan was first to make sure that we can really get the localization
project
going and that we have enough forces to get through before we join the
official
project at your side.
I think we are advancing quickly and we would be happy to join your ranks.

&gt;<i> anyway, the fact that you enhancement are rpm packaged and
</I>&gt;<i> installable, does not means that these will not be wiped by the system
</I>&gt;<i> updates ... all your changes will be futile especially to mklivecd wich
</I>&gt;<i> is maintained by n#2 of mypclinuxos developers : ivan keres who will
</I>&gt;<i> certainly be interrested in your hacks for integration in the main stream.
</I>
I know my packages cannot collide with the official ones. Therefore I never
make
updates of existing packages. Our mklivecd package has different name and
contains only the renamed skript, so it does not interfere with anything
else.
Of course, the possibility of pushing our changes upstream you are talking
about
is much better that this.

&gt;<i> anyways, if you could send me a documented version of your changes or at
</I>&gt;<i> least a diff of those files so i could investigate the usage of those
</I>&gt;<i> &quot;molested&quot; files for the team to use it ...
</I>
I'm sending you the patch against original mklivecd version.
There are three new options:

   --bootmenu &lt;file&gt;       What boot menu definition file should be used
                           in case that bootloader option is set to iso or
grub.
                           For iso this file must be named 'isolinux.cfg',
                           for grub the name must be 'menu.lst'.
                           Boot menu will be generated if not specified.

   --boottheme &lt;name&gt;      Which gfxboot theme should be used.
                           Defaults to 'pclinuxos'

   --bootlang &lt;lang code&gt;  Which language shound be used as default
                           in the boot menu.
                           Defaults to 'en'.

These options add flexibility to the mklivecd script - without them it
should
behave exactly the same as the original one.

I'm also sending you another patch - this one is for script /etc/rc.d/rc.
There is a overlooked limitation in the original script: when shutting down,
the
message &quot;Shutting down the system...Press Esc for verbose mode&quot; won't get
translated to language set in /etc/sysconfig/i18n. (In contrast with startup
message - here reinstalling bootsplash package is sufficient to get it
localized).
Packager of 'initscripts' package is Texstar. I wonder if you can persue him
to
incorporate this little change.

&gt;<i> i'm yet working on 3 scripts that altos sent me, in order to convert
</I>&gt;<i> them to po files for the changes to be system wide and more robust
</I>&gt;<i> towards system updates. this will also help us get the status of the
</I>&gt;<i> czeck translation.
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>&gt;<i> you can hook with the project member this way :
</I>&gt;<i> <A HREF="http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=1012.0">http://www.mypclinuxos.com/forum/index.php?topic=1012.0</A>
</I>&gt;<i>
</I>
I'll take a look.


Regards,

David
