Hi didouph,Sorry to hear about you pc.I've gotten more involved with the pclos team since I undertook to supplycompiz-fusion to the community.  I've offered to Tex to act as liaisonbetween you guys and the pclos team (I'll rebuild the packages using yourwork and send them to Tex for inclusion).  He'll add Synaptic soon buthasn't yet decided how to handle the other packages.Until I get a decision from Tex, please do not mention this e-mail.I'll need the cvs pserver link to be able to download your work so far aswell as a prioritisation of the packages.I hope you get back online soon.Gettinther
